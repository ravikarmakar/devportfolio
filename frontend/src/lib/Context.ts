      # My Journey from Physics to Full Stack Development

      When I first started my journey in Physics, I never imagined I'd end up becoming a Full Stack Developer. Here's my story...

      ## The Beginning
      As a Physics student, I was always fascinated by how things worked at their most fundamental level...

      ## The Transition
      My programming journey began when I needed to analyze data for my physics experiments...

      ## Learning Web Development
      I started with the basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript...

      ## Where I Am Now
      Today, I work with modern technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB...
